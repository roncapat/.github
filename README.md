# Hi, I'm Patrick!

<p align="justify">
I'm a robotics engineer with a background in software engineering. I work for Thales Alenia Space in Italy, where I produly participate in a number of different projects supporting Moon and Mars exploration 🚀🧑‍🚀.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I'm currently working on:
<ul align="justify">
<li>an Autonomous Navigation solution based on ROS 2, enabling exploration rovers to safely and autonomously navigate in an unstructured, static environment :robot:.</li>
<li>an Adaptive Locomotion System for lunar exploration, enabling access to craters and supporting novel types of activities like ISRU and infrastructure management 🚙.</li>
</ul align="justify">
</p>
<p align="justify">
In my spare time I like to contribute to the ROS 2 ecosystem, either via bugfixing or little new features, and a bunch of packages that are publicly accessible here on github.
</p>

## ROS 2
I developed my custom <a href="https://github.com/roncapat/ros2_native_adapters">ROS 2 Type Adapters</a>.
I also wrote some <a href="https://github.com/roncapat/ros2-native-adapters-examples">examples</a> to demonstrate how to implement them in your own code to leverage intra-process communication in ROS 2 scenarios.
